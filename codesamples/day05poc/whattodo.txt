1. look at poc.js

phase 1

2  in the js file keep your product array global.
3. write a logic function 
    1. sorted by price..  return type is an array.
    2. sorted by qty .. return type is an array
    3. sorted by dateadded. return type is an array.
    4. have a logic function whose input is category, return type is an array ..
    which will have those category elemeents.
    5. write a logic function whose input is price rturn type is an array 
    which will have those price elemeents
    6. write .... (verbal reasoning test..)

    broad logic.
    sorting   -- return type is an array..
    filtering  -- input is parmetr, return type is filtered array... 
    logic   
      array is empty, no elements met the criteria
      array is filled up, these elements met the criteria.

    so summary is how many functions.. 8 logic functions

check whether this logic functions work..

phase 2..
