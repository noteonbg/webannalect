/* Default styles */
h2 {
    color: blue; /* Default color for all <h2> elements */
}

/* Specific styles for product titles */
.product-title {
    color: red; /* This will be overridden */
    font-size: 20px;
}

/* More specific selector with higher specificity */
.product h2 {
    color: green; /* This will take precedence over the other two rules */
}


/*


Use Specific Selectors Wisely: Aim to write clear and concise selectors that target elements directly,
 rather than relying on multiple classes or IDs.
 
Avoid Over-Specificity: Using too many class or ID selectors can lead to
 complicated styles that are hard to override later.

Follow a Naming Convention: Using conventions like BEM (Block Element Modifier) can help
 maintain clarity in class naming and reduce the need for overrides.

Organize Stylesheets: Group related styles together and document them to keep track
 of what styles are applied to which elements.

Use Consistent Class Names: Establish a consistent naming scheme for your
 classes to make it easier to remember which styles apply to which elements.
