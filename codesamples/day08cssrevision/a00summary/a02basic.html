Absolute Units (px):

.absolute-container has a fixed width of 400px and height of 200px. This will always be the
 same size, regardless of the size of the viewport or any other surrounding element.
.absolute-text uses a font size of 16px, which will always be 16 pixels high
 regardless of the parent element or viewport.


Relative Units (%, vh, em):
.relative-container has a width of 50%, which means it will take up 50% of the width
 of its parent container (in this case, the body element). The height is set to 50vh,
  which is 50% of the viewport height, so it adjusts dynamically as the viewport height changes.
.relative-text uses a font size of 2em, which is relative to the font size of the parent container. If the parent container's font size changes, the text will grow or shrink proportionally.

When to Use Absolute Units:
Fixed sizes: When you need an element to have a specific, unchanging size 
regardless of its parent or viewport size.
Example: A logo that must be 200px wide or a specific image size.

Precise control: When you're working with specific designs where exact pixel dimensions are
 needed (e.g., borders, shadows, and exact spacing).

 Example: An element that should always be a specific width, such as a navigation bar
  or a button.

  When to Use Relative Units:
Responsive designs: When you want elements to scale based on the 
parent container or viewport.

Example:
 A card layout where the width of cards should adjust with the screen size 
 or window size.

Font scaling: When you want text size to scale with the userâ€™s settings 
or to scale relative to the container size.
 em and rem are often used for this purpose.

Example: Responsive typography where the text size increases or decreases 
relative to the parent container or the root element.

Flexible layouts: When designing fluid layouts that adapt to the screen size 
(like using vw, vh, or % for width, height, and spacing).

Example: A content section that takes up the full height of the viewport (100vh).

Summary:
Use absolute units (px, in, pt) for fixed, precise measurements that do not change
 relative to the surrounding environment.

Use relative units (%, em, rem, vh, vw) for flexible and scalable designs that
 adapt to the parent element or the viewport size, making them more suitable 
 for responsive layouts and user accessibility preferences.

This combination of absolute and relative units helps to create layouts that are both
fixed in certain places (for precision) and fluid where necessary (for responsiveness).
