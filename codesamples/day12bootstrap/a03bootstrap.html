    <!-- Default .container: It has fixed widths that change at different breakpoints (e.g., 100% width on small screens, but fixed width on large screens) -->
    <div class="container" style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 20px;">
        <h2>Container (Fixed-width)</h2>
        <p>This is a fixed-width container. It adjusts its width based on the screen size but has predefined maximum widths at different breakpoints. For example, on large screens, it may be 1140px wide.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <!-- .container-fluid: It spans the entire width of the viewport, regardless of screen size -->
    <div class="container-fluid" style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 20px;">
        <h2>Container Fluid (Full-width)</h2>
        <p>This is a fluid container. It takes up the full width of the viewport, meaning it stretches from edge to edge of the screen at any screen size.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <!-- .container-sm: It behaves like a container, but with a smaller max-width at the 'sm' breakpoint -->
    <div class="container-sm" style="background-color: lightcoral; padding: 20px;">
        <h2>Container with 'sm' Breakpoint</h2>
        <p>This container will have a max-width that applies to the 'sm' (small) breakpoint and up. On smaller screens, it takes up 100% width, but on screens larger than 576px, it becomes constrained to a smaller max-width.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <!-- .container-md: It behaves like a container, but with a max-width at the 'md' breakpoint -->
    <div class="container-md" style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; padding: 20px;">
        <h2>Container with 'md' Breakpoint</h2>
        <p>This container has a max-width that applies from the 'md' (medium) breakpoint and up. It behaves like a fixed-width container at medium and larger screen sizes.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <!-- .container-lg: It behaves like a container, but with a max-width at the 'lg' breakpoint -->
    <div class="container-lg" style="background-color: lightgray; padding: 20px;">
        <h2>Container with 'lg' Breakpoint</h2>
        <p>This container will have a maximum width at the 'lg' (large) breakpoint and above. It will adjust based on the screen size, but will remain constrained on larger screens.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <!-- .container-xl: It behaves like a container, but with a max-width at the 'xl' breakpoint -->
    <div class="container-xl" style="background-color: lightpink; padding: 20px;">
        <h2>Container with 'xl' Breakpoint</h2>
        <p>This container will have a max-width that applies at the 'xl' (extra-large) breakpoint. On smaller screens, it behaves like a full-width container, but becomes constrained as the screen size increases.</p>
    </div>
