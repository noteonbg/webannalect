1. not to byheart any css properties at the same time.. go randomly exploring css.
2. if html is not fixed and it is shaky.. thinking of css is quite a bad process.
3. ensure your html, css and javascript
folder
   html pages
   js\js file
   css\css file

phase1
    1. login, postlogin. logoff

phase 2
phase 3

We should just refuse anything that tells there is "lot of things to learn" is mainly because of not generalizing enough
refuse to learn syntaxes.. just think of syntax as on need basis you will find out..

telescope... always products come with features first and then standards move slowly to have those features..
playing video in the html page is normal thing.. video tag..
once upon a time.. real player and which was plugin needed to play the video.

what all frameworks we use in the project at presentation level.. = more opinions of doing the same thing with different syntaxes..
in name of making things easier..

framework == opinion...  == generalizing your learning..

css..
1. layout of the html page should be clear for you
2. start learning the syntax for writing header.. start footer, start syntax for the body..
3. you make a list of html page designs you are looking for..


framework..
0. our loyalty is towards project
1. which layer of architecture it fits in.  -- jquery.. web based presentation.. level
2. it will have an opinion on how to do things..--you to have know what its opinion..
3. which programming language does it support.
4. we have to start using its functions and objects...






with respect to jquery..

1. to use jquery include the jquery file from a CDN (content delivery network)
2. any product, they guy wants everybody to use it, so is jquery..
he will provide userguide and documentation..

1. you told let me wait till page is loaded... (
domcontentloaded event with the document object.
that becomes

for people who try to remember syntax, "Hell" is about to begin..

what we want do with jquery..

1. when the page is loaded, setup events.
2. access sections of the html
3. know which section we are accessing.. input box, div or span
4. read its content or change its content.
5. use css along with it..

in javascript we split our code into two parts.
1. logic part  -- will not change because of jquery  -- project specific thing..

2. ui ( event handling,accesing html )  --this part will change.


for all logic functions what is most important thing you are looking for?
all logic functions should return... something. based on which we can judge whether function succeeded or failed.
if your logic function did not return, it was not a logic function..

ui will all the logic function
and ui has to know whether logic function succeeded or failed.
why basedon that only ui will upate itself..

when in doubt can you write a small program.



$(document).ready(()=>{} );  --earlier version
or
$(()=>{});  lter version 

what is equivalent this in javascript

document.addEventLIstener("domcontentloaded


$('#addButton').click(()=>{});  // registering for event..
$('#addButton').click();// event has occured

$('#num1').val()  , get the value of the textbox

document.getElementById("num1").value;

#("#num1").va1("23");

when ever you are seeing fuction calls and open ocumentation and see what it does..


jquery
1. setup events
2. access parts of html
3. do some logic
4. change the parts of html

javascript == super set
library == ready made functions written in javascript which make thing "simpler" hopefully.




what part of the page, will change , what part will not change..
what all events you want to react to..
layout of the page..




$(()=>{
        console.log("please work");
    });

if you hate the above you should work on jquery.. because you are not agreeing to jquery opinion..

doing kichadi stuff. of mixing raw javascript and jquery syntax together.. for ui manipulation bad idea..
once you start using jquery, start using jquery way of doing things..


//registering for the event domcontentloaded..



we are calling $ function and we are passing another function as input argument to it.
what does it mean..

$ function entire page is loaded, then call the function which we passed.




IT industry... side effect  == lot of noise in the brain
    

how do you know jquery is working
if jquery function is working, it means jquery is working.

if you are back let me know..
