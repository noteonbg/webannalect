moral of the story.

everybody agrees that practical is important..
but zero theory means you have unlimited practicals..


1. architecture to code..
2. web.. http
3. html,css and javascript all doing different jobs..
4. in any project if we have view what will change, what will not change.
that will give a context how things look like..
5. we need a process to begin in any multistep process.
5. I want to write html page  -- do you which part of page will page
which part of page willnot change.. this will give a clue as to how to use id..
6. approach of html.
6.1 focus on html part.
6.2 css part...
6.3 javascript part

quick intro on css and javascript..
practical thing would be know some css to make some modifications..
being decent in javascript and gettings things done is realistic.

user friendly website..
1. no scrolling.
2. whatever you do number of clicks should be max 3 or less than 3..
3. consistency... in color usage, in font usage, in layout...

html5 has got some tags, these tags get interpreted by the browser..
predefined tags...

deciding on the structure of the page..
form..group things..
individual components in the form...

<form action="where to process the request"  method="post"
<input type="text" id="javascript/css" name="for server side compeonnt"

method="http mode of sending the request"

semantic web.. some more html tags.. 
some basics of css.
Event handling.
javascript


in any website.

1. we have some information first...
2. we want to divide the page into sections.
3. inevitably there will be mechanisms to go different sections of the website or same web page...
to indicate 3 we use the nav tag.. only nav tag alone will not do anything, inside hte nav tag we have
to use some kind of links... ( routing)

div tag  -- very old thing.. pre 2000 before html5 .. manage almost entire page by using div, span..
nav tag, is an introduction after html 5... semantic structure...

post html5 world is we will use semantic tags to indicate the intent ...
ie we want a header we want a footer..

what do you know in html

1. some structure tags...
	. hyperlink,div,span, semantic web.
2. form tags.. action, method, id , name.. submit and normal button.
3. why we give id.. to indicate changing part of the page..


basic terminoology
<input name="abc" id="t1" value="x"/> --tag
name, id or value is considered as attributes..

for any form component we need three things.
1. label. which user can see and know what it communicates, place holder, label...
2. name and id... name is used to recongize the information on the server side, id is used
to pick the infomration in the client side,, (within javascript function)
3. value... is value is contnet of the ui component.
example 
we enter something in the textbox how does the programmer come to know the conent of the textbox... by using value..
we have a radio button

value is important for all ui components,for textbox and its cousins.. content of textbox is the value
for non textbox components like radio dropdown... value has to be specified else we land up with logical
errors in the code..

I cannot show any example right way I have to talk about javascript
you can process the value in the html... you can process it on server side... or you in context of processing
in client side.. in javascript

Div --big superset..
semantic web tags... came after div to give logical meaning to the html page...

javascript

1. respect it as a new programming language...
2. people javascript is a scripting language... all this story is dead.. in todays world javascrpt
is  programming language, as you can talk about c or c++

what we can do with javascript anything you want...

every programming language today is free..every programming languages wants developers...
but in our context, why javascript.. because brower understands it..

what are we going to do with javascript.

1. set up some events in our web page.
2. when that event occurs some function is getting called by the system.
3. in that function what we will do.
3.1 pick some section of the html page
3.2  do some logic
3.3 update the page.

programming language.
1. we should have idea regarding architecture...
entry point, exit point how is your layering going on...

we want access sections of html page let us call it as X.
we want to do some logic.. let us call it as Y.
dont mix x and y... doing that is called as architecture...
how do you know something is not having an architecture change X, change everything in code..dont trust check...

how many js files are you going to create and why.... basis for that will be architecture..

javascript  -- this part if we ignore we will busy lot of English explanations and we will lot of volume of data to process.
function
functiond definition
function calling
function assignment

variable..
data type
scope..

how do you write javscript...
1. we can write html page
2. we can write it separately and link it..


<script>
function functionname()
{
	console.log("function getting called");

}

</script>

when you define the function
1. think who is going to call it, if you have no idea, dont define the function.


<button onclick="f1()"
dont tell f1 is getting called...
f1 is getting assigned...
we are telling the browser hey look when the click event happens then you must call the f1 function.

Event handling..
some change occurs and you have to report the change..
change occurs == variable value changes... 

in javascript 99% of our job will be to react to events.
that means

1. system will detect changes. and it will have a mechanism to report to us... provided we tell
the system hey look I am interested in this changes 

telling the system I am interested in this change.. event registration.
so in javscript

we should have clarity as to what is meaning of event..
we are event listeners most of times and not event causers...
who is detecting the event system.
who is telling I am interested in the event.. let me know.. we..

whenever you setup event handling... understand syntax wise there is  function assignment at work...
some times syntax will look like function calling...


respect javascript as a new language.. dont compare it with anything python... java or javascript




remember these rules.

1. function define
1.1 think who is going to call it.
1.2 also think how will you tell the caller function succed or function failed or does not matter..

2. function calling
2.1 open documentation... else we will do astrology on the function.


3. function assignment.
remember this is a mechanism to store function as a variable..or assign a function to a variable....
remember when we function assignment it means two people are there X and Y.
X is assigning the function, it means X is owner of the function, and X is not the caller of the function.


how to create a variables and what data types are there

data type... means content + operation..
you choose data type based on the operation you want..

two ways for todays world in javascript how to create variables..
let x ="hello";
x="hi"
x=false;
x=[];

const x ="hello";  // this way means x cannot be reassigned

let x="hello"
x=have only the string type you cannot enforce.. in javascript.

quick summary
1. awareness regarding semantic html tags..
2. javascript learn it as a new language...
3. function . define, call or assign
4. variable creation in javascript.. think of let or const.. depending on whether you want reassignment or not..

standard stupidity if we can avoid great, else we will join the party..
lot of people dont have the decency to respect javascript a new language, they want to compare it with 
something they know....like java or c++ or python... this is pathetic.. so what some people have done is
put fancy dress for javascript call it with  new name and make it look like java or c++ , example typescript.
but any person who does not know javascript should not use the word web for presentation.

learn to write javascript functions.
when you define, pleas think who is going to call it..

you can write n functions in javascript
but be conscious which is event handling function and which one is not..
why never use return in eventhandling functions because we are not calling what will system will do with
the return...

in all event handling functions.. we are event listeners..
event handling is one way communication

from event source to event listener.. event lister cannot talk back to the event source..






rule no avoid writing global variables in real life, for today we will use global variables..










javsacript has got data types, i tells dont tell me what the data type i will judge it dynamically.






quick summary of javascript

1. respect javascript as a new language..
2. function... 
define  -- think who is going to call it, kid will tell I will call it.. many a times in javascript system will calling
it.. what we wrote was a event handling function.
assign  -- this is what we do during event handling.. tell somebody hey look here is my function, you call it under
some circumstance..
call  -- open documentation.
3. variable creation..
let
const
data type is recognized by javascript dynamically.

let x ="Hell"
let y ="o"
let z = x+y; + is defined with string...
console.log(z);



let x ="Hello"
let y ="o"
let z = x-y;  // minus operation is not defined in string datatype.
console.log(z);

what is moral. data type means decide operation and pick your type..
no i dont want to decide on my operation.. ok in that case dont create the variable..

let x ="hello"
let y= x.toUppercase();  //function call, open documentation and read it...dont assume.
console.log(x); // HELLO it wont... 
y will bein uppercase...

open documentation when you do function calls in any programming language dont assume..

data types in javascript we will leanr it on need basis..

array..   
a contiguous allocation in memory... with a fixed size.. this is standard definition of array in any programming language

but in javascript array does not have a size.

let x=[];//this is an array..
x.push(3);//you can add elements in to the array.

for(let y=0; y< x.length; y++)
{
	console.log(x[y]);
}

let x={}// x is an object or X is a dictionary.. key and value pairs..
let x = {length:3, breadth:4 };
x[length]=7;
x[breadth]=4;

let x=0;
x="abc";

write a javascript function that takes a string as argument and returns the uppercase string
call it in the script tag, supply argument as hello.. and see what is output you are getting.

write a function takes two numbers and returns product of that number .
2.30PM

write a  javascript function which takes an array of 5 numbers and returns the sum of the array.
let x =[2,3,4,5,6];
x.length
for...

write a javascript function whose input is a number and it returns 5 multiples of the number.
example if we input as 5, it should return 5,10,15,20,25
if input is 2, it should return 2,4,6,8,10
use the method called push to add an element into the array.


	object or dictionary..
	let x ={ m1:3, m2:"hello"}
	let x = { productid:4, sales:44 }
	console.log(x[productid])

	function whose input argument is an object or dictionary  { length:4, breadth:5 }
	return type should be  { perimeter: 18, area :20 }

	input argument is a object  { length, breadth }
	return type is an object  { perimeter, area }

	what we should know is
	how to write a function in javascript takes a simple type like a number, array, and an object as input
	and returns as output.

	one very important thing to recognize in any programming language is to know the data type we are having.
	
	let x ="3";
	let y = x-1;
	
	we should always be conscious what data type we are holding in the variable because operations
	are decided on the basis of that only.

	we are in the browser...the browser has got mechanism to process javascript that is reason
	we are able to run our functions in the browser.
	
	the browser has got various objects which is made available to us in our javascript code.
	localstorage.
	geolocation
	document
	navigator.
	you get other objects also depending on which object you got properties and behavour will change..



	
	how to access sections of the html page in our javascript function.
	

	

	access section of the html page.. textbox, some html tag..
	do some business logic
	update the page or navigate to a different page.
	
	dont byheart the syntax, why syntax is non standardized each framework comes with an opinion
 	of this needs to be done..

	demonstate consciousness in javascript how..
	when you tell give this element by Id... remember for which element did you get it..
	in this case we got for a span element..

	s1)	read some value from the ui.
	s2)	some business logic -- contact the python server get the data...
	s3)     change things in the ui. (how change part of the html page or go to another page..)


	reading book gives you pleasure but never makes us useful in a project..
	project means tolerate uncertainty, when we have a doubt, can we write a small program.

	99% cases in javascript our job will be pass objects between functions and return also will objects.. 

	when you set up events dont assume event handlin is working check check check..

	kids hate constraints adults like constraints..
